# Bucket Sort

----

## About:


Bucket Sort, or Bin Sort, operates by partitioning an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm. It is mainly useful when the input is uniformly distributed over a range.

## Run Times:

- **Best-case:** \(O(n+k)\)
- **Average-case:** \(O(n+k)\)
- **Worst-case:** \(O(n^2)\)

# Counting Sort

----

## About:

For educational purposes: Counting Sort is a non-comparative sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

This example includes a function, countingSort, which takes an array arr and the maximum value maxValue in the array as arguments. The function sorts the elements of the array and returns the sorted array. Note that it's important to know the range of the input data to use Counting Sort effectively, as this determines the size of the counting array.

## Run Times:

- **Best-case:** \(O(n+k)\)
- **Average-case:** \(O(n+k)\)
- **Worst-case:** \(O(n+k)\)

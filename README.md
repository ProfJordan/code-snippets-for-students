# ProfJordan's â€“ Code Snippets for Web Development Students

A collection of misc code snippets initially put together to help teach students a concept when asked. The collection is currently unorganized and used mainly as a teaching tool & saved here so I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time a student asks a similar question. But I may try to upload more consistently whenever I think of a code snippet that may be userful for a student. Please feel free to use them and contribute should you have any ideas for snippets.

## Todo
1. Add more snippets
2. Ensure all snippets are functioning correctly still
3. ~~Categorize / Organize the snippets better~~
4. Add Readme's to all snippets explaining function/purpose
5. ~~Add best-case, average and worst-case time complexity to sorting algorithms~~

## Contribute
Contributions welcome. If you have a good snippet you'd like to add. Send a PR.

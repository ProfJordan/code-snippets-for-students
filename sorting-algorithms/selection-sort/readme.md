## About:

For educational purposes, here's how you might implement a simple sorting algorithm in JavaScript that emphasizes the process of remembering the lowest and highest values in each iteration.

## Run Times:

- **Best-case:** \(O(n^2)\)
- **Average-case:** \(O(n^2)\)
- **Worst-case:** \(O(n^2)\)

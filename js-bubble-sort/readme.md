# Bubble Sort

For educational purposes: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort is not very efficient for large datasets compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.

This function, bubbleSort, takes an array arr as input and sorts the array in ascending order. The swapped flag is used to keep track of whether any swaps have been made during a pass through the array. If no swaps occur, the array is considered sorted, and the algorithm terminates.

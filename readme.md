# code-snippets-for-students

A collection of misc code snippets put together to help teach students a concept when asked. The collection is unorganized and used mainly as a teaching tool & saved here so I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time a student asks a similar question. But feel free to use them and contribute should you have any ideas for snippets.
